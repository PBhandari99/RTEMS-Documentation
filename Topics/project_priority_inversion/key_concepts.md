This documents contains a summary of what I have learned about rtems from the C-User guide's chapter 2: Key Concepts

# Objects
RTEMS provides directives which can be used to dynamically create, delete, and manipulate a set of predefined object types. These types include tasks, message queues, semaphores, memory regions, memory partitions, timers, ports, and rate monotonic periods.

1. Object Name:
  - data_type `rtems_name` is used to store object names
  - The `rtems_build_name` routine is provided to build an object name from four ASCII characters.
  e.g
  ```
    rtems_name my_name;
    my_name = rtems_build_name( 'L', 'I', 'T', 'E' );
  ```
  - `rtems_object_get_name` can be used to obtain the name of any RTEMS object using just its ID. This routine attempts to convert the name into a printable string.
  ```
  #include <rtems.h>
  #include <rtems/bspIo.h> void print_name(rtems_id id) {
    char buffer[10]; /* name assumed to be 10 characters or less */ char *result;
    result = rtems_object_get_name( id, sizeof(buffer), buffer );
    printk( "ID=0x%08x name=%s\n", id, ((result) ? result : "no name") );
  }
  ```

2. Object ID:
  - An object ID is a unique unsigned integer value which uniquely identifies an object instance. Object IDs are passed as arguments to many directives in RTEMS and RTEMS translates the ID to an internal object pointer.
  - The thirty-two bit format for an object ID is composed of four parts: API, object class, node, and index.
  - The sixteen bit format for an object ID is composed of three parts: API, object class, and index.
  - The data type `rtems_id` is used to store object IDs.
  - The object ID is required as input to all directives involving objects, except those which create an object or obtain the ID of an object.

# Communication and Synchronization
A real-time executive should provide an application with the following capabilities:
  - Data transfer between cooperating tasks
  - Data transfer between tasks and ISRs
  - Synchronization of cooperating tasks
  - Synchronization of tasks and ISRs

The following managers were specifically designed for communication and synchronization:
  -  **Semaphore**: The semaphore manager supports mutual exclusion involving the synchronization
    of access to one or more shared user resources. Binary semaphores may utilize
    the optional priority inheritance algorithm to avoid the problem of priority
    inversion.
  -  **Message Queue**: The message manager sup- ports both communication and synchronization.
  -  **Event**: The event manager primarily provides a high performance synchronization mechanism.
  -  **Signal**: The signal manager supports only asynchronous communication and is typically used for exception handling.

# Locking Protocols
RTEMS supports the four locking protocols. For this project, we are focusing on the Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP).
  - **Immediate Ceiling Priority Protocol (ICPP)**: 
  Each mutex using the Immediate Ceiling Priority Protocol (ICPP) has a ceiling priority.
  The priority of the mutex owner is immediately raised to the ceiling priority of the mutex.
  In case the thread owning the mutex releases the mutex, then the normal priority of the thread is restored.
  *This requires an overall knowledge of the application as a whole.
  The need to identify the highest priority thread which will attempt to obtain a particular mutex can be a difficult task in a large, complicated system.*
  - **Priority Inheritance Protocol**: The priority of the mutex owner is raised to the highest priority of all threads that currently wait for ownership of this mutex

  - **Multiprocessor Resource Sharing Protocol (MrsP)**: 
  The Multiprocessor Resource Sharing Protocol (MrsP) is a generalization of the priority ceiling protocol to clustered scheduling.
  - **O(m) Independence-Preserving Protocol (OMIP)**: it is a generalization of the PIP to clustered scheduling which avoids the non-preemptive sections present with priority boosting.

Since RTEMS 5.1, priority updates due to the locking protocols take place immediately and are propagated recursively.
The mutex owner and wait for mutex relationships define a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
The run-time of the mutex obtain, release and timeout operations depend on the complexity of this resource dependency graph.

# Thread Queues
In case more than one thread may wait on a synchronization object, e.g. a semaphore or a message queue, then the waiting threads are added to a data structure called the thread queue.
Thread queues are named task wait queues in the Classic API.
There are two thread queuing disciplines available which define the order of the threads on a particular thread queue.
Threads can wait in FIFO or priority order.
A doubly-linked list (chain) is used to implement the FIFO queues yielding a ùëÇ(1) worst-case time complexity for enqueue and dequeue operations.
A red-black tree is used to implement the priority queues yielding a ùëÇ(ùëôùëúùëî(ùëõ)) worst-case time complexity for enqueue and dequeue operations with ùëõ being the count of threads already on the queue.

We will only deal with uni-processor, so I am skipping all details for SMP.

# Time
The basic unit of time in RTEMS is known as a clock tick or simply tick.
The tick interval is defined by the application configuration option `CONFIGURE_MICROSECONDS_PER_TICK`.
The tick interval defines the basic resolution of all interval and calendar time operations.
Obviously, the directives which use intervals or wall time cannot operate without some external mechanism which provides a periodic clock tick.
This clock tick is provided by the clock driver.
The tick precision and stability depends on the clock driver and interrupt latency. Most clock drivers provide a timecounter to measure the time with a higher resolution than the tick.
By tracking time in units of ticks, RTEMS is capable of supporting interval timing functions such as task delays, timeouts, timeslicing, the delayed execution of timer service routines, and the rate monotonic scheduling of tasks.
An interval is defined as a number of ticks relative to the current time.
For example, when a task delays for an interval of ten ticks, it is implied that the task will not execute until ten clock ticks have occurred.
All intervals are specified using data type `rtems_interval`.
